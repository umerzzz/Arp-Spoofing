# 🔐 ARP Spoofing Lab Manual – Man-in-the-Middle Attack Using Bettercap

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab manual focused on **ARP spoofing** and **traffic interception** using **Bettercap**. This manual demonstrates how attackers can perform a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack on a local network and how network traffic can be sniffed, intercepted, or manipulated.

## 📚 What's Inside

This manual contains:

- ✅ Pre-attack setup (target IP, ARP table, MAC addresses)
- ✅ Launching Bettercap on Linux interface (e.g., eth0)
- ✅ Enabling probing and ARP spoofing modules
- ✅ Observing ARP table changes before and after the attack
- ✅ Automating the attack with custom caplet scripts
- ✅ Verifying successful spoofing and live packet interception

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Bettercap** – Powerful MITM attack and network monitoring tool  
- **Wireshark** *(optional)* – For verifying intercepted traffic  
- **Linux Terminal** – Running commands and managing network interfaces

set arp.spoof.targets <target_ip>
arp.spoof on
net.sniff on

To run:

```bash
bettercap -iface eth0 -caplet arp_spoof.cap
```
